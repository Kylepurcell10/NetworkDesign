Environment
-Operating System used: Windows 10
-Programming language used: Python
-Version used: Python 3.9.2

Instructions
-This code was developed using Visual Studio Code. When opening the files in Visual Studio Code, they will appear in tabs along the top of the IDE. 
-First, run the “server.py” using the “run without debugging” in the “run” tab at the top of the IDE. 
-Then you go to the “client.py” tab and “run without debugging” again. 
-You will get a notification in the terminal showing the packets being sent.
-If it was sucessful, we should end up with a file on the server side.
-To see the server side, hit the drop-down menu where it says “2. Python Debug console” and go to “1. Python Debug console”. 
-There the both the client's address and port number will be printed out along with the notification saying that the checksums and packets are ok.
-The image received by the client should be the same as the one sent to the server. 
Note: In our case, the image turned into bytes
