Environment
-Operating System used: Windows 10
-Programming language used: Python
-Version used: Python 3.9.2

Instructions
-This code was developed using Visual Studio Code. When opening the files in Visual Studio Code, they will appear in tabs along the top of the IDE. 
-First, run the “server.py” using the “run without debugging” in the “run” tab at the top of the IDE. 
-Then you go to the “client.py” tab and “run without debugging” again. 
-You will get a notification in the terminal that the server has "Received the data".
-To see the server side, hit the drop-down menu where it says “2. Python Debug console” and go to “1. Python Debug console”. 
-There the both the client's address and port number will be printed out along with the notification saying "Sent the data". 
-The image received by the client will be shown as a bmp image int a file called "receive.bmp" 
-In our case, we used both cat and a trash bin icon to show that the image on "receive.bmp" can easily be changed between these two. 
NOTE: If these files are saved somewhere else other than the desktop than the full path name needs to be given in both the open() functions in each of the files.
